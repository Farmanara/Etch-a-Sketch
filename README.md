this is the javaScript basic project I'm gonna start, it should be difficult as the guide says so .
it is a pad of many square divs that changes darkness when mouse hovers on it.. that all I know for now

UPDATE:
well the project is done, and at the end it is a Sketch pad with the default density of 16 rows and 16 columns, 
when the mouse hovers over each square ,the sqaure color changes from the default gray to a random color.

there's also a "Create New" button that you can use to have a clean sketch pad and start over.
the default density can also be changed when you click the "Create New" button and enter your desired density.
e.g if you enter 32 , you will have a new Sketch pad containing 32 rows and 32 columns, the size of the whole board is the same, so you will have a higher resolution board as it will have more squares in it.
